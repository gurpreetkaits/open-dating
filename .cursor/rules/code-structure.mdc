// Backend PHP Code Structure

1. Always follow best code practices
2. Use Manager directory to create Manager files (App\\Managers\\ExampleManager)
3. Use Manager to handle business logic (no database request should made  through Manager)
4. Use Service files (App\\Services\\ExampleService) to make Database request
5. Controller should be used to consume and response 
6. Pattern Should be Frontend -> Controller -> Manager -> Service/Model 
7. Use LaravelData instead of passing arrays to method params (App\\Data\\ExampleData) 
8. Less logs / no comments but use explaining variables / less console.log(frontend)
